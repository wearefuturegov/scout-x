[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/27801f71-59f2-4186-9587-9a2669e7edb2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hungry-wozniak-46471f/deploys)

ðŸš¨ **This is BETA software. Please file an issue for any bugs** ðŸš¨

A simple API-driven front-end for local authority service directories and local offers.

It's intended for use with [Outpost](https://github.com/wearefuturegov/outpost) and its [API service](https://github.com/wearefuturegov/outpost-api-service/), but, with some tweaks, could consume any API that follows the [Open Community standard](https://opencommunity.org.uk/).

## ðŸ§± How it's made

It's a client-rendered React app, built on [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).

The pinboard feature uses localstorage, and it has one email-sending function that is intended to run on [Netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/).

## ðŸ’» Running it locally

### Using docker

```sh
git clone git@github.com:wearefuturegov/scout-x.git && cd scout-x

# build the image - if using for the first time
docker build --tag test-scout:development --target development .

# run the image in local environment
docker run -p 3003:3000 --name test-scout -v $(pwd):/app:cached -i -d test-scout:development

# access the site
open http://localhost:3003/

# open shell in container
docker exec -it test-scout /bin/ash;

# stop the container
docker stop test-scout

# start again
docker start test-scout
```

### Using docker-compose

```sh
git clone git@github.com:wearefuturegov/scout-x.git && cd scout-x

# build the image
docker compose -f docker-compose.development.yml build

# run the container
docker compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up -d

# open shell in container
docker compose -f docker-compose.development.yml exec scout-dev /bin/ash;

# stop the container
docker compose -f docker-compose.development.yml stop

```

### Locally

You need Node.js and `npm` installed, plus an API for Scout to consume data from.

First, clone the repo:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Before building, it will attempt to grab the latest version of the collection, category and SEND needs filters if there's an appropriate datasource available.

It'll be on **localhost:3000**.

### Serverless functions

To test out the email-sending function locally you'll need to install [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/) and use `netlify dev` to start the app instead.

It should be on port 8888.

## ðŸŒŽ Running it on the web

[![Deploy](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/wearefuturegov/scout-x)

It's suitable for [any static host](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment), such as Netlify.

Run the `npm run build` command and then serve the `/build` folder.

If you want to use the built-in email sending function, you'll _need_ to host it on Netlify.

### Docker

You can also deploy via docker

```sh
# build the image
docker compose build

# run the container
docker compose up -d
```

## ðŸ§¬ Configuration

You can configure it using a `.env` file locally. Run `cp .env.example .env` to make a fresh one.

## ðŸ§ª Tests and linting

It uses Prettier to enforce code style, along with Jest for unit tests and Cypress for integration/UI tests.

Make sure you have the server running before you run the Cypress tests. You can run all the tests with:

```
npm test
```

You can lint with:

```
npm run lint
```

### Run locally on docker

**Linting**

```sh
docker exec -it test-scout npm run lint
```

**Unit tests**

```sh
docker exec -it test-scout npm run test:unit
```
