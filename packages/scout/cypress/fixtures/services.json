We increase effective learning by reducing barriers that prevent learning. We teach functionally equivalent skills to replace behaviours that may challenge.\nTelehealth ABA Programmes will allow for families to have access to ABA programmes through the use of technology.  It is cost-effective for families with a child who cannot meet in traditional standards of face-to-face consultations and examinations. It can improve the child's health through real-time communication between the therapist and the child in a remote environment.  ABA Horizons makes use of electronic communication using audio and video equipment to engage with the child.  This allows for flexibility and for the family and child to receive high-quality services.\nDirect Services - Our direct ABA services consist of 1:1 therapy provided to your child for a specified number of hours per week in the home or community setting. The exact number of hours will be based on assessment results and what we think will work best for you. Direct services will be implemented by an RBT® or RBT® in training.  We understand that ABA services can be expensive and time-consuming, therefore we want our services to be accessible and work for your budget. If you are interested in direct ABA services, there are three possible RBT® options available to you:  ABA Horizons provides a tutor with RBT® certification. You provide a tutor that already has RBT® certification or that we can train to RBT® standard. You work directly with your child and ABA Horizons will train you to RBT® standard.\nIn addition to 1:1 therapy, it is recommended that parents/caregivers receive parent training to run alongside therapy. The purpose of parent training is to ensure that the skills your child learns during therapy generalise to other people and settings.

      "description": "Due to Coronavirus (COVID-19) this Short Breaks Service is currently closed. Find out more on the Short Breaks Page.\nCoronavirus (Covid-19) – Short Breaks Service Closure We have recently had to make the difficult decision to close our short breaks services provided by Action for Children due to the coronavirus outbreak. We want to keep families and our care and health workers safe. This means that we must follow government guidance on staying at home and social distancing. Letters have been sent out to all families who are affected by this decision. We are committed to reopening short breaks services as soon as it is safe to do so and we will continue to contact families directly with any updates. Updates will also be posted on this page.\nIn the meantime it is important that you keep yourself and others safe by following government guidance on staying at home and social distancing. The Council has set up a community support hub with lots of advice and information www.buckinghamshire.gov.uk/coronavirus\nWe know that this a very worrying time for many families and we are doing all we can to offer continued support to parents, carers and children.\nIf you are worried and need help you can contact us as follows:\n\nIf your child/ren have a social worker please call 01296 383 762\nIf your family has a family support worker from the Early Help Service please call 01296 383293\nIf your child/ren do not have a social worker or a family support worker please call First Response Team: Telephone: 01296 383 962 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm) If you need an urgent response outside of these hours, contact the Emergency Duty Team on 0800 999 7677\n\n\n\nWe provide short breaks for children with disabilities and/or additional learning needs, giving parents and carers a rest from their caring responsibilities and chance for children and young people to gain independence, socialise with peers and have fun! Our sessions include a mix of venue based sessions and activities out and about in the local community at weekends and during school holidays. We also run youth clubs for teens in High Wycombe and Aylesbury. Staff are on hand to meet the needs of each individual child, supporting them to participate fully in the activity they are attending.\nHow to book: Please register your child with Bucks Activity Project by emailing us at Bucks.activity@actionforchildren.org.uk or telephone the office on 01296 438230.\n ",
